# Weather-App
Welcome to my weather forecast website! I created this page as a way to check the current weather for any city, as well as get the next 5 days forecast. The weather forecast information comes from https://openweathermap.org/forecast5 and using this api, the webpage pulls the data and displays it for the user to view. There is also a function that saves the 10 most recent searched cities, and when clicked, it will display that city's weather forecast.

I had some help from an amazing youtube video on the GreatStack youtube channel. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIYQR-Ybrn4&t=2061s. This video helped me get a better understanding of how to use the weather api and create functions to display the data pulled from the api. I used the video to help build the checkWeather function and used the weather icons the video provided.
